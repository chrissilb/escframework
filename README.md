## Contribution
If YOU like to contribute to the project this is what you could do:
* The escframework should be also provided in other programming languages, e.g. C++, C#, Python. This should not be done manually but AI-supported.
* The escframework should support web development.
* The slides on gwasch.de should be translated from German into English. This should not be done manually but AI-supported.
* Test the framework and report bugs.

Thank you very much!
