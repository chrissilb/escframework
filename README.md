## Next Steps
* Provide DemoLibrary
* Provide DemoProductionSystem
* Provide DemoThreadPool
* Complete Javadoc
* Provide example for UndoAction
* Complete standard actions (Loop, Sequence, Parallel) plus example
* Provide autoDelegate
* Provide inheritance of extensions
* Provide remote proxy
* Provide Garbage Collection for components

* Installation and user guide
* Put on Maven Central
  
## Contribution
If YOU like to contribute to the project this is what you could do:
* The escframework should be also provided in other programming languages, e.g. C++, C#, Python. This should not be done manually but AI-supported.
* The escframework should support web development.
* The slides on [gwasch.de](https://gwasch.de) should be translated from German into English. This should not be done manually but AI-supported into as much languages as possible.
* Test the framework and report bugs.

Thank you very much!
